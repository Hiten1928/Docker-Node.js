# DockerTestApp

The image can be pulled by command:

  docker pull hiten3008/node

After successfully pulling the image, the build can be triggered using :

  docker image build hiten3008/node:latest

The application listens on port 80. So, the default localhost is 80.

This is a simple custom image built on docker in Node.Js and is simple but extendable to any Node.Js developers.
